# HttpClient_API_Automation

Try to impplement the, HttpClient Api process, HttpClient is a low level client for simplifying Http Communication, 
In-fact HttpClient is used by REST Assured under the hood for Http communication.
To Run the each testcases you have to run the each test cases manually using TestNG suit.

Eclipse as an IDE
Selenium, free automating testing frame work and the Scripting language used is java with some advanced java concepts.(did my research).

for pushing the code to the Repo. Git bash command line is used.
Code reusability can be improved. 

/* Still the  Projet has some errors but you can see the implementation */
for one test case i also used the restAssured to see how both works. 
we can do lots of improvment in the framework level.
